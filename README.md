## Useful Textbooks

We will largely rely on material freely available on the web; however, these two books may be useful for a more in-depth dive:

 * [Lutz: Learning Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do)
 * [VanderPlas: Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)

(note: both are freely available as e-books through UW University Libraries).

## Class Description

ASTR 302, “Python for Astronomy”, is a new course designed to teach how to
effectively use Python for research and astronomical data analysis.  We
will begin with a gentle introduction to key tools and libraries used in
astronomy, use these to analyze data (from kilobytes to tens of gigabytes!),
visualize (sometimes large) datasets, automate analyses, and apply what
we’ve learned to reproduce results of some key astronomy papers.

This course assumes the knowledge of Python and related astronomy libraries
at the ASTR 300 level.  It will give you the broad foundation needed to
proceed to “ASTR 324: Introduction to AstroStatistics and Big Data in
Astronomy”, or ASTR 497 “Big Data in Astronomy: Hands-on with Large
Surveys”, or independent research projects.
